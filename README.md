### **Problem Statement:**
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of individuals worldwide, leading to serious health complications if not managed effectively. Identifying and understanding the factors contributing to diabetes can help in early diagnosis, prevention, and management strategies. This project aims to analyze a comprehensive diabetes dataset to uncover patterns and relationships among key variables, including age, gender, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c levels, and blood glucose levels.

### **Key Questions:**
1. What are the most significant demographic and health-related factors associated with diabetes prevalence?
2. How does the prevalence of diabetes differ across age groups, genders, and BMI categories?
3. What is the relationship between diabetes and other health conditions such as hypertension and heart disease?
4. How does smoking history impact the risk of developing diabetes?

### **Key Insights:**
Age and Diabetes Prevalence:

* **A significant majority of diabetes cases are found in individuals over the age of 36, with 7,937 positive cases out of 8,463 total positives, compared to only 526 cases under the age of 36.
The average age in the dataset is approximately 41.78 years, with the 50th percentile (median) being 43 years.
Gender and Diabetes Prevalence:**

There are 38,606 total male entries and 4,031 males positive for diabetes, whereas there are 53,962 total female entries with 4,432 females testing positive for diabetes.
While the total number of females in the dataset is higher, the proportion of diabetes cases is fairly balanced between genders.
Blood Glucose and HbA1c Levels:

The average blood glucose level for individuals positive for diabetes is significantly higher at 193.96, compared to 132.79 for those negative for diabetes.
Similarly, the average HbA1c level is elevated in individuals with diabetes at 6.93, compared to 5.4 for those without the condition, indicating poorer long-term glucose control in diabetics.
BMI and Health Conditions:

Among BMI categories, the obese group has the highest count of diabetes cases (4,231), hypertension (1,143), and heart disease (594), underscoring obesity as a major risk factor.
Healthy-weight individuals have significantly lower counts of diabetes (836), hypertension (185), and heart disease (151).
Smoking History and Diabetes:

Individuals with a history of smoking ('Current' and 'Former') show a notable number of diabetes cases, with 948 current smokers and 2,280 former smokers testing positive.
Never-smokers also account for a large number of diabetes cases (3,799), suggesting that while smoking is a risk factor, other factors are also at play.
Age Group and Gender Distribution:

The dataset indicates an increase in diabetes prevalence with age, with the highest counts in the 71-100 age group for both females (1,322) and males (1,145).
The gender distribution shows a consistent pattern across all age groups, with slightly higher female counts for older age groups.
Health Profile Overview:

On average, individuals with diabetes tend to have higher BMI, blood glucose levels, and HbA1c levels, aligning with known risk factors for diabetes.
The prevalence of hypertension and heart disease is also higher in individuals with diabetes, highlighting the common occurrence of these comorbid conditions.
