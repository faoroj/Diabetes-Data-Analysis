### **Problem Statement:**
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of individuals worldwide, leading to serious health complications if not managed effectively. Identifying and understanding the factors contributing to diabetes can help in early diagnosis, prevention, and management strategies. This project aims to analyze a comprehensive diabetes dataset to uncover patterns and relationships among key variables, including age, gender, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c levels, and blood glucose levels.

### **Key Questions:**
1. What are the most significant demographic and health-related factors associated with diabetes prevalence?
2. How does the prevalence of diabetes differ across age groups, genders, and BMI categories?
3. What is the relationship between diabetes and other health conditions such as hypertension and heart disease?
4. How does smoking history impact the risk of developing diabetes?
